First of all I want to mention that all of my applications may be are not appropriate for this environment ((github)) because, my apps are not reusable or a pkg that you could be able to expand it or use in other projects but I am trying and hardworking everyday to reach that point. This repository is an application with specific language that use others repositories. My apps are so little, but I am looking forward to make a bigger one.
